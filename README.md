This project aims to create a small power distribution unit and control it via a Web based control center. The PDU has a basic functionality of:
  - Distributing electricity from a source to multiple loads 
	- Automatic source switching from the main source to the backup source and vice versa in case of power outage 
  - Sending sensor data of (current, voltage, power source) to the web server via Wi-Fi
  - Receiving control commands for each load from the server 
  - Auto source disconnecting in case of overvoltage or overcurrent 

The web server has basic functions of:
-	A User Interface : 
  Monitoring real-time load status and power consumption.
  Manual or scheduled load control for optimized energy use.
-	Data storage: 
  Securely stores power consumption and voltage data for each load, facilitating future analysis.
- Event logging: 
  Logs all power outages, overcurrent, and overvoltage events for troubleshooting and trend analysis.
- Load prioritization: 
  Enables users to prioritize critical loads based on their preferences.
- Data visualization: 
  Provides insightful graphs and analytics to understand system performance.
- Load management: 
  Allows users to set load limits according to their preferences, promoting efficient energy consumption.
